The can2040 project is a software CAN bus implementation for Raspberry
Pi [rp2040](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/rp2040/) and
[rp2350](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/rp2350/)
micro-controllers.  It enables these chips to implement
[CAN bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus) using a standard CAN
transceiver chip.  The code supports reading and writing CAN 2.0B data
frames at rates up to 1Mbit per second.
